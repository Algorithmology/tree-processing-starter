# Processing Filesystem Trees

## Add Your Name Here

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## Program Output

### Use three fenced code blocks to provide output from three different runs of `treeprocessor` for three different directories provided to the `--directory` command

#### Provide the command the output for the run of the `treeprocessor` and the first directory

TODO: Provide the complete command-line for your use of the `treeprocessor` program

TODO: Provide the output that the `treeprocessor` program produced

TODO: Make sure that each run is for a unique directory specified on the command-line of `treeprocessor`

#### Provide the command the output for the run of the `treeprocessor` and the second directory

TODO: Provide the complete command-line for your use of the `treeprocessor` program

TODO: Provide the output that the `treeprocessor` program produced

TODO: Make sure that each run is for a unique directory specified on the command-line of `treeprocessor`

#### Provide the command the output for the run of the `treeprocessor` and the third directory

TODO: Provide the complete command-line for your use of the `treeprocessor` program

TODO: Provide the output that the `treeprocessor` program produced

TODO: Make sure that each run is for a unique directory specified on the command-line of `treeprocessor`

## Professional Development

### Are there any differences in the sizes of files across different operating systems?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### What is challenging about building a hierarchical representation of a filesystem?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### Reference one source code function that you implemented and write one paragraph to explain it

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### Take Home Points

TODO: Provide a two to three sentence statement about the key takeaways from
completing this project. Please note that the course instructor will display
some student takeaways on the course web site and use them to facilitate
follow-on class discussions. The takeways that you write should be specifically
connected to the system that you implemented for filesystem traversal.
